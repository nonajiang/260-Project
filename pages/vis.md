## Visualizations

We conducted several analyses and create visualizations to help users with their job search.

### How does average salary relate with average living expenses in each city?

The plot shows a relationship that did not surprise us: the higher the living expenses, the higher the salary. This plot could be useful

### What are the highest paying occupations in various cities?

To answer this question and display it in a visually appealing way, we created several word clouds from professions that had salaries in the top 5th percentile. We did this first for all 50 cities and then for several cities to see if there are any differences between cities.

It looks like professions in medicine, engineering, and computer-related fields are high-paying fields as a whole.

Now let's take a look at Boston specifically:

In Boston, where there is great emphasis on the healthcare industry, once again we see a strong representation of physicians. Similar to the word cloud nationally, computer-related fields and engineering also offer high-paying salaries in Boston.

What about on the West Coast in San Francisco?

In the Bay Area, we can see that there are more high-paying jobs in the computer science industry with the words "computer" and "engineer" appearing the most frequently.
