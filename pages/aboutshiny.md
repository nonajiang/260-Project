## About the Shiny App

This page offers a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use our dashboard. Suppose you are a recent graduate searching for your dream job and follow along!

## Congratulations!

You did it! The long nights in the library, the sleepless nights cramming epidemiology formulas, and the countless hours spent on group projects have finally paid off. So...now what?

You have just graduated with your Master's in Biostatistics and in hand you have not one - but TWO job offers as a Statistician. One offer is for a start-up here in Boston starting at $75,000. The other is for a company in Pheonix, Arizona starting at $80,000. You have two great jobs with fairly similar starting salaries though in very different locations.

Let's take a look to see how the Checks & Cities dashboard can help navigate your job decision-making.

## How does my salary offer compare to others?

## Is this enough to live off of?

## Will I have enough money for fun?

## Should I move to Arizona or stay in Boston?
