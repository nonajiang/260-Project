## Let's Use this App

This page offers a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use our dashboard. Suppose you are a recent graduate searching for your dream job and follow along!

### Congratulations!

You did it! The sleepless nights in the library cramming epidemiology formulas, the countless hours spent poring over probability homework, and the mental anguish experienced while fighting with R Studio on a daily basis (why won't it knit?!) have all finally paid off. You have just graduated with your Master's in Biostatistics, and you are feeling pretty darn good about yourself. Now that this chapter of your life has come to a close...now what?

Being the stellar student you are, you have in hand not one but two job offers as a statistician. Your first offer is for a start-up here in Boston with a salary of $90,000. The other offer is at a company back where you are from in Pheonix, Arizona with a salary of $80,000.

You are thrilled to have two great job offers with fairly similar starting salaries albeit in very different locations. Let's take a look to see how the Checks & Cities dashboard can help you decide which job to accept!

### How does my salary offer compare to others in the same city?

Let's take a look at how the salaries you are offered compare with the average salary across all professions in each given city.

First, let's look at Boston

Now, let's look at Pheonix

### Will this be enough to live off of?

### To move or not to move? That is the question...

While your Boston job pays a higher salary, it is clear that the cost of living is lower in Pheonix and that your salary will go farther in Pheonix. After extensive conversations with your advisors, it appears both job opportunities are great and will open doors. This in conjunction with the proximity to your family and the higher discretionary income youwould have (which you learned about from the dashboard!), you ultimately decide to make the trek back across the country to Pheonix where you can enjoy warmer weather, incredible hiking, and frequent weekend getaways to Sedona - with all your discretionary income (:
