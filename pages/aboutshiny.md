## Let's Use this App

This page offers a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use our dashboard. Suppose you are a recent graduate searching for your dream job and follow along!

### Congratulations!

![](/Graduation.jpeg){:width="500"}

You did it! The sleepless nights in the library cramming epidemiology formulas, the countless hours spent poring over probability homework, and the mental anguish experienced while fighting with R Studio on a daily basis have all finally paid off. You have just graduated with your Master's in Biostatistics, and you are feeling pretty darn good about yourself. Now that this chapter of your life has come to a close...now what?

Being the stellar student you are, you have in hand not one but two job offers as a statistician. Your first offer is for a start-up here in Boston with a salary of $90,000. The other offer is at a company back where you are from in Pheonix, Arizona with a salary of $80,000.

You are thrilled to have two great job offers with fairly similar starting salaries albeit in very different locations. Let's take a look to see how the Checks & Cities dashboard can help you decide which job to accept!

### How does my salary offer compare to others in the same city?

Let's take a look at how the salaries you are offered compare with the average salary across all professions in each given city.

First, let's take look at Boston:

You learn that the average salary across all professions in Boston $73,850. Your offer is looking not too shabby!

Now, let's take look at Phoenix:

Looks like the average salary across all professions in Phoenix is $54,870, which is noticeably less than Boston - perhaps your salary can go a little further here?

### How does my offer compare to other statisticians?

To see how your salary compares with the average salary in your ocupation of interest, you can easily use the second tab of the dashboard.

You see that the average salary of a statistician in Boston is $118,900 and that the average salary of a statistician in Phoenix is $96,560

### Will this be enough for me to live off of?

To look into the average cost of living in each city and to compare both offers, you can easily do this on the third tab of the dashboard. By simply inputting your salary offers and the cities each are in, several plots are generated.

The first plot compares the average monthly expenses in each city. The app calculates the average cost of living in the city of interest which is defined as the sum of: 

- 16 inexpensive meals at restaurants (because the average American eats out 4 times a week)
- apartment cost in city center for one bedroom
- basic utilities such as electricity, cooling, water, garbage for 915 sq ft apartment
- internet (speed 60 mbps or more)

The second plot compares the monthly salary based off your inputted salary.

Finally, the third plot compares the discretionary income you would have taking each other, which is simply the average cost of living subtracted from your monthyl salary.

Looking at these plots, you see that while your monthly salary in Boston is greater than that in Phoenix, after acocunting for cost of living you would actually have more discretonary income taking the job in Phoenix.

### To move or not to move? That is the question...

While your Boston job pays a higher salary, it is clear that the cost of living is lower in Pheonix and that your salary will go farther in Pheonix. After extensive conversations with your advisors, it appears both job opportunities are great and will open doors. This in conjunction with the proximity to your family and the higher discretionary income you would have (which you learned about from the dashboard!), you ultimately decide to make the trek back across the country to Pheonix. You are excited to start your new job as a statistician while enjoyin warmer weather, incredible hiking, and frequent weekend getaways to Sedona - with all your discretionary income :)
