You did it! The sleepless nights in the library cramming epidemiology formulas, the countless hours spent poring over probability homework, and the mental energy expended fighting with R Studio on a daily basis (why won't it knit?!) have finally all paid off. You have just graduated with your Master's in Biostatistics! So...now what?

Being the stellar student you are, you have in hand not one but two job offers as a statistician. Your first offer is for a start-up here in Boston with a salary of $90,000. The other offer is at a company back where you are from in Pheonix, Arizona with a salary of $80,000.

You are thrilled to have two great job offers with fairly similar starting salaries though in very different locations but feel conflicted about which job to take. Let's take a look to see how the Checks & Cities dashboard can help you decide which job to accept!

## How does my salary offer compare to others in the same city?

Let's take a look at how the salaries you are offered compare with the average salary across all professions in each given city.

First, let's look at Boston

## Will this be enough to live off of? Will I have enough money for fun? Will I be able to save?

## Should I move back to Arizona or stay in Boston?
